# Textile-Blender
3D Rendering via Golem using files uploaded to Textile Hubs (IPFS).

# To Run
Follow Golem Blender [tutorial] (https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development) setup instructions through "Enable the daemon as a requestor" to establish node. Then run "TextileBlender.py", found in the yapapi/examples/blender/TextileBlender.py

# To Do
- Pull Blender file to render from Filecoin (via dCompute hosted Textile Powergate)
- Push rendered files to IPFS/Filecoin
- (Once Golem opens direct network access for providers) have providers pull Blender file and push rendered files to/from IPFS/Filecoin directly.
